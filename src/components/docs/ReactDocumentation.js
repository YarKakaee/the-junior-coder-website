						To download react, you need to first install node on
						your computer. To do that, go to{" "}
						<Link to="//nodejs.org/en/" text="nodejs.org" /> and
						click on Downloads. Once you're there, choose your
						operating system and follow the installation wizard.
						Next, open up command prompt and type:
						<CodeBlock codeString="npm i create-react-app" />
						Once that is installed, you can create a project using:
						<CodeBlock codeString="create-react-app my-first-react-app" />
						And start your website on a local server using:
						<CodeBlock codeString={Code1()} />
					</Paragraph>

					<SubHeading text="Creating your first Website" />
					<Paragraph>
						First, open the project you just created in a code
						editor (
						<Link
							to="//code.visualstudio.com"
							text="Visual Studio"
						/>
						), and go to <strong>app.js</strong>. This is what you
						first see in this file:
						<CodeBlock codeString={Code2()} />
						Change that to this:
						<CodeBlock codeString={Code3()} />
						Go to{" "}
						<Link to="//localhost:3000" text="localhost:3000" /> in
						your browser and you should see "Hello World" on your
						website.
